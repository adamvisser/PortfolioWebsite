				<p>The unexpected is our normal routine. Damage report! I'll alert the crew. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Talk about going nowhere fast. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. How long can two people talk about nothing? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. You enjoyed that. I am your worst nightmare! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.</p>
