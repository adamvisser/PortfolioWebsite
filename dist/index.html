									While searching for a new job I was given the challenge to program battleship as a web app. The challenge itself asked a lot less of me than what I am doing, but I saw this as a good chance to get deeper into web sockets. This idea also fueled a challenge with myself to see if I could gain as many new skills in three months of hard work, as I could in a year of contract work at Autodesk.
