I am completing a coding challenge for a new job opportunity and you get to follow along! I will be both taking you along for the ride as well as documenting anything that I want to send to them as "notes/thoughts/etc" while I work through this. So what am I building? Battleship.

Well sort of, I don't actually get the players to place their ships. It is not required and it would just take too much time. The requirements are that we need to have two players, and 100% client side code. They want it open ended to see what decisions I make, so that is very exciting!

First off I was asked my thoughts about this, so lets take note of those before I get fully started:
<blockquote>I am going to sound super cocky here, but I think I have an edge here as one of my room mates while in college was a game designer so I know a lot about this. Writing it 100% client side makes the game loop a lot easier to write as well. It wasn't until recently with the mass acceptance of web sockets that you could get an easy game loop going with a server acting as a middle man. I am sure you are already thinking of the amount of load you could put on something if you followed the traditional pattern of running the game loop 30 times in a second. So I don't have to do any of the complicated game design stuff that would normally bog me down, I just want it to be pretty. This is where the challenge comes in... More on this soon.</blockquote>
So right now I am setting up a work space folder to create a basic game loop run through Angular.js. All it really needs to do is, for each player ask for them to take a shot, check if its a hit, do something cool and/or pretty if it's a hit, check if that was there is a winner and if not then move on to the next player. So while I would love to go into detail about how I set this work space up, there are many steps to code in this situation. What I actually send to the company I am applying for will change as I go through this, so thats where I leave you for now! I need to actually do this so I really appreciate you following along. <a href="http://adamvisser.me/2016/06/02/games-too/">Check out the next post in the series here: 'Games Too'.</a>
