So I started working on everything, then I ended up falling asleep... I thought I was going to wake up early to finish everything off but it seems like my habit of sleeping through alarms is striking again. Time for yet another new alarm. Regardless... Where are we with this coding challenge?
<blockquote>To get everything started off it involved copying over a gulp file which has been used by a lot of my projects. This is good as it saves me time in managing assets, but bad as the gulp file itself has a lot of stuff in it from random projects, and some of the lines/dependencies for my gulp setup never actually get used.... So what did I use to actually get this setup? Well to get everything developed all nicely I am leveraging bower and gulp to compile all of my JS files into a single file, as well as compiling my .scss files. Since this gulp file also leverages Browser Sync I get the advantage of that as well. Since I am using AngularJS, Browser Sync isn't really working at this time, but the dev server that "gulp watch" launches does work. The only libraries I needed to get the front end built was Angular, some Angular NGs, and SemanticUI. The Angular NGs are Route and Animate. I would like to involve animate, but I am feeling like I will run out of time before I can. I Will take it out if I cant get it in there.</blockquote>
It took a bit of doing to get all the files in place and ready to go. With the files in place I was able to setup a few different routes to actually run the game. Things got interesting when trying to decide how to get this done as fast as possible, while still showing off as much as possible. Making things pretty takes a lot of time, and making them super pretty is a life long journey it seems. This is why its such a challenge to make things pretty. Hence why I mentioned the whole thing about possibly having to take out Angular Animate. So thats how I have this project setup meaning that its time to move on to how the different parts of the app actually run. <a href="http://adamvisser.me/2016/06/02/alarms/">Check out the next part of this series in: 'Alarms'.</a>
