<p>I will admit that one of my faults it to get hung up on things as I tend to be very meticulous. OCD actually runs in my family so I guess I got grazed by that bullet: I have OCD for code. This coding challenge that I have been pushing for didn't seem to work out the way I wanted it to, but fear not my readers! The challenge has inspired me to turn a new leaf and find another angle to come at this job thing...</p>

<p>Reader, there is much that needs to be done. I need to be straight to the point. I need an online presence. Most importantly I need to show off some skills. My goals for this challenge will be realized through this approach.</p>

<p>Welcome to the rest of the uninhibited series of Two Months of Code (TMoC). The coding challenge will be doctored up in some later posts. Priority now dictates that we build out the current website (what you are seeing now). I already have my copy backed up and ready for editing. We will be jumping straight into how we will structure out this WordPress theme.</p>
