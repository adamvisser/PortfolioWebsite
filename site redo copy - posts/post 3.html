Pretty annoyed that I had slept through my alarm so we are working at light speed today to make sure that it doesn't leave me at a disadvantage. Drinking all this coffee has me really thinking about a couple of really epic things to do with getting this setup. We can leverage some of AngularJS's built in features like directives and services. We will use the directives to display the board, and interact with it. While we will be using services to actually keep track of the board, check for winners, and the majority of the game logic.

AngularJS services and directives are basically implementations of the singleton and decorator pattern respectively.
<blockquote>By leveraging services through AngularJS it became very easy to have a singleton that would act as the authority of the game itself. This authority would hold the data for the game boards independent of the routes actually taken. This would allow me to load data in the background while the user is going through the welcome and instruction screens. I don't have a need to load data at this time, but its a very big part of game design and thusly will not be taken out. You have to know when to follow the standards, and when you can get away without following them. By using directives it becomes very easy to have a single view that would be able to interact with two different sets of player views. Through this theory I was also able to keep the number of boards being kept in memory low. A real game might have to have more boards than I just because one board is rendered red while the other blue. Luckily I don't even have pointers to memory, so would never be able to get a large enough data set that rendering becomes something I have to take control over. For now using directives is more than enough rendering control to make this game happen.</blockquote>
At this point I am feeling fairly confident about getting this built. I have created a lot of really cool ideas that will help me to keep everything simple and crisp, so hopefully that works in my favor.
<blockquote>With the major parts of this app figured out it is now time to start building out the skeleton of each of those parts, and stringing them together. The welcome page and instruction page were quick and simple, grammar was the hardest part there as I write more code than english on the daily. Since I am using SemanticUI I already have the CSS needed to create a nice responsive grid layout so I am going to go ahead and do that now. With the grid in place I will need to create the board grid and the directives needed to get interactions with the board working. I will write back more after seeing how hard my ideas for building this out actually are.</blockquote>
So there ya heard it folks, I am going to have to write back soon with more about the progress of my coding challenge and my two months of code. <a href="http://adamvisser.me/2016/06/02/priorities/">Read the next entry in this series titled: 'Priorities'.</a>
