So at this point I have a lot of code written for this challenge. There is no code to display the boards themselves, but we have some logic to check if a shot is a hit, and some hard coded numbers to setup the boards. My priority here is to get something turned in ASAP, but how far does one take something this open ended?

Lets take an example here, I saved the first git commit for something like this, <a href="https://github.com/adamvisser/battleship-code-challenge/commit/d16ed7aea704e778774ff7e9d448bf1900d8983a" target="_blank">so take a look at my first git commit in this project to check out my code so far</a>. Normally you wouldn't want this much code changed on the first commit, but as I am the only one who will ever work on this, I think I will be ok. Now there are a few things worth mentioning here.

I am currently placing the ships on the board with no logic/randomness/etc. Right now there is no logic to check if an entire ship has been taken out, but there is logic ready to be written if a player wins or loses. Also I am trying to keep my services and directives loosely coupled so right now there is only the service, and no directive. The logic to check if a whole ship has been destroyed or not is probably the big thing needed here, so I will talk about that a bit:
<blockquote>Since I have 5 ships but no ship object or collection, it becomes easier to track hit counts than which ships are alive or dead. In this case all I have really created are a handful of grids with zeroes or ones on them. This one or zero can be used to check if a ship is there, and changing the one to a two upon a hit will allow for an easy change on the rendering of the boards. The directive I have yet to write will simply do nothing to the square if its a 0, add a css class to make the square grey if its a 1, or add a css class to make the square black if its been hit. This keeps my board directive reusable and will hopefully keep me from needing to call any services from within the directive. Calling the service from the directive would break my loosely coupled goals, and I'm all about completing goals.</blockquote>
You can take a look at just the ship placement code by <a href="https://github.com/adamvisser/battleship-code-challenge/commit/a933c77535d6cd19711e9bcd4d26785500d27fe9" target="_blank">taking a look at this commit here</a>. You will quickly notice how this could easily be done with an algorithm, as long as that algorithm checks that ships do not go over the edge, or overlap each other. Due to that logic needing to be in the algorithm itself I opted to just hard code the ships boards, and move on to taking shots. Always focus on the priority list.
<blockquote>My priority is to get this challenge submitted before the end of the week, so I have to be willing to compromise on certain aspects of the app itself. In this case it means getting rid of the classic phrase "You sunk my battleship". Hard coding the ships boards allows me to quickly move on to taking shots, and that is a larger portion of the UI/UX than the placement of the ships. So while I certainly got sucked in by the amount of possibility with this challenge, I didn't completely lose myself in it.</blockquote>
I already have a pretty good bit of code in place to take shots at each other, so now we have to focus on what will really get me the job, the user experience and interface of actually playing this game. Check out the next part of the series titled: 'Flow'.
