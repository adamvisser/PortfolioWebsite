Structure.



<p>For a custom WordPress theme to actually operate you will have to ensure that you have a standard set of files. Some are not required in this list but you will most likely want the following files in your theme folder:
	<ul>
		<li class="ui popup" data-content="For code reusability.">header.php</li>
		<li class="ui popup" data-content="Almost always required in Web Dev.">index.php</li>
		<li class="ui popup" data-content="This allows for a Landing page like many modern sites.">front-page.php</li>
		<li class="ui popup" data-content="This styles each blog post. A blog post should feel different than a page.">single.php</li>
		<li class="ui popup" data-content="This is required for your theme to load into WordPress.">style.css</li>
		<li class="ui popup" data-content="For code reusability.">footer.php</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Hovering over each item in that list will give you a brief explanation of why these things are needed or note Needed. By habbit they are just what I start with, but never finish with this few files. I typically try to have header.php hold all the html code that sits before the fold of the website. In terms of where to start on designing, I always start with the landing page as it sets the mood for the rest of the experience.</p>

<p>I want my landing page to feel very alive, like my personality. It will also have to have a way to immediatly display the things that are important at that time in my career. As my color cordination is not always up to par we will have to leverage a css/js framework that has a lot of colors and flashy options. SemanticUI is in my wheelhouse and fills all the needs listed so far.</p>
