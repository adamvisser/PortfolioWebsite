				<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
				<p>As society creates a higher and higher demand for organic foods the possibility of an inflated market becomes greater and greater. Instead of organic foods being an alternative to the typical GMO ridden fruits and vegetables, it will be viewed as a different, higher up, tier of food. As it stands now a vast number of families view eating at McDonalds on a regular interval a good option due to its cheapness and convenience. Until it becomes easy and cheap to get ogranic foods onto low income families tables, the circle of an overweight society will continue.</p>
				<div class="ui divider"></div>
				<p>By not only allowing farmers to produce organic goods at a fraction of the cost, but also removing the knowledge barrier to entry for growing ones own food, Growbotix is allowing people of today to grow the food of the future.</p>
